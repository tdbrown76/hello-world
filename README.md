# hello-world
Initial Repository

I am Timothy, the Research Coordinator for the University of Florida's LearnDialogue research laboratory.
This is my first exposure to Github and I'm only writing this to familiarize myself with how this environment works and what things I will be able to do here.

There are no changes to be made at this time.
